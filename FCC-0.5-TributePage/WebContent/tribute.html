            <p id="quoteText">"The value of Yogananda's <i>Autobiography</i> is greatly enhanced by the fact that it is one of the few books in English about the wise men of India which has been written, not by a journalist or foreigner, but by one of their own race and training -- in short, a book <i>about</i> yogis <i>by</i> a yogi."</p>
